#### Alternative (and unofficial) icons to pimp your Atom 1.0!

If you enjoyed the [1.0 release of your favourite editor](http://atom.io), here's a way to celebrate it with a new icon!

I really liked the graphics accompanying [Atom's blog entry announcing version 1.0 of the editor](http://blog.atom.io/2015/06/25/atom-1-0.html), and I thought that it would be cool to have those nice colours on the application icon in the Dock. So... I made this.

**Enjoy!**

PS. More to come...

### Instructions

#### OSX: How to change Atom's application icon in the Dock


1. Download desired **.icns** icon file to your disk
2. Select the downloaded icon file in Finder, and hit **CMD+i** to reveal its info panel
3. Click on the small icon in top of the panel (left to the name), a blue outline should appear around it, hit **CMD+c** to copy the icon.
4. Quit Atom (if open)
5. **CMD+click** on Atom icon in the Dock to reveal it in the **/Applications** folder (it will be auto selected), or simply locate Atom in that folder and select it.
5. Hit **CMD+i** to reveal info panel for Atom application
6. Click on the small Atom icon in top of the panel, a blue outline should appear around it, hit **CMD+v** to paste the new icon you copied in step 3.
7. Sit back, and **enjoy!**


Unfortunately at this point I have no instructions for other OSes but I'll try to get them here.

Please let me know if there's anything wrong with the icons!
